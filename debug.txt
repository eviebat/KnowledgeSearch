Spoke with Cannon to verifiy that they would replace the phone under these circumstances.
Cannon said that they probably would not since it had been too long since the phone was originally ordered.

Bradley,

I just spoke with the Cannon group regarding the damage to your phone. According to them, they would probably not accept the warranty exchange on that phone since it has been a while since the phone was originally ordered. In order to order a replacement, you would have to speak with one of your business champions. Their contact information is:

Hey Steve,

Here is the number for the Samsung support line: 1-800-726-7864
Also, if they can’t figure out a solution for you, I’m attaching the information for your business champion. It looks like you’re out of your contract date if you need a new one. This is assuming Samsung can’t help. I would recommend talking to one of your business champions. Here is their info…




If you have any other questions, feel free to reach out.

Thanks,

Good morning.

I have an iPhone 5c (I think) that has taken a severe blow to the screen and “spider webbed” cracked. I have to use this phone daily to take pictures for the store audits I perform. The cracks on the touch screen make it very difficult to control the camera and basically all other functions of the phone. I left a voice mail with Sammy Diaz yesterday and again this morning but have not had a return call. Please understand the urgency for the need of this phone to conduct my job. If someone would get back in touch with me at your earliest convenience it would be greatly appreciated.

The cracks on the touch screen make it very difficult to control the camera and basically all other functions of the phone. I left a voice mail with Sammy Diaz yesterday and again this morning but have not had a return call. Please understand the urgency for the need of this phone to conduct my job. If someone would get back in touch with me at your earliest convenience it would be greatly appreciated.

Good morning.

I have an iPhone 5c (I think) that has taken a severe blow to the screen and “spider webbed” cracked. I have to use this phone daily to take pictures for the store audits I perform. The cracks on the touch screen make it very difficult to control the camera and basically all other functions of the phone. I left a voice mail with Sammy Diaz yesterday and again this morning but have not had a return call. Please understand the urgency for the need of this phone to conduct my job.
